# Proxmox Installation, Setup & Troubleshooting 

This project is a comprehensive guide designed to help users effectively install, configure, and troubleshoot Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE), a powerful open-source platform for managing virtual machines (VMs) and containers. Additionally, this guide covers the setup of specific services that can be deployed on Proxmox, making it a one-stop resource for both beginners and advanced users in the DevOps and IT infrastructure space.

Proxmox VE is widely used for virtualization, offering a robust and flexible environment for running VMs, containers, and hybrid workloads. However, setting it up and optimizing it for specific use cases can be challenging. This project aims to simplify that process by providing clear, step-by-step instructions, best practices, and troubleshooting tips.
